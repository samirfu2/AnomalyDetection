## AnomalyDetection
##### Anomaly detection is the identification of data points, items, observations or events that do not conform to the expected pattern of a given group. 
##### Anomaly detection is heavily used in behavioral analysis and other forms of analysis in order to aid in learning about the detection, identification and prediction of the occurrence of these anomalies.

#### Techniques for anomaly detection include:
1) One-class support vector machines
2) Determination of records that deviate from learned association rules
3) Distance-based techniques
4) Replicator neural networks
Cluster analysis-based anomaly detection
#### Specific techniques for anomaly detection in security applications include:
1) Profiling methods
2) Statistical methods
3) Rule-based systems
4) Model-based approaches
5) Distance based methods
